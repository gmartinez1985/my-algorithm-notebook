# My Algorithm Notebook

This repository contains my personal solutions to algorithm and programming challenges.  
Each problem is implemented in Java and includes a detailed `README.md` with:

- how I approached the problem,
- possible solutions I considered,
- my final implementation and why I chose it.

Problems are grouped by category (e.g., recursion, greedy, two pointers...) and each folder contains both the code and my step-by-step explanation.
